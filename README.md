# Flutter architecture starting templates

A collection of popular architectures used when developing Flutter applications. The setup and folder structure that each of these skeletons contain is a personal prefence of mine. Each skeleton has it's own readme to explain the application structure and which files goes where. 

In this repo you can find skeletons for the following architectures.

- [Redux](https://github.com/FilledStacks/flutter-architecture-skeletons/tree/master/redux_arch)

- [Scoped Model](https://github.com/FilledStacks/flutter-architecture-skeletons/tree/master/scopedmodel)

Follow or star this repo to receive updates of when I add new skeletons.
